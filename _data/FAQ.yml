- question: Is HHEU affiliated with Major League Hacking (MLH)?
  answer: >-
    HHEU is a community-driven collection of hackathon organisers who want to do more to support UK and European hackathons. While there is an overlap of interest between who's involved in HHEU and MLH, they're distinctly separate entities.

- question: Is it free?
  answer: |
     HHEU wants to support the hackathon community in the UK and Europe. In the past, events like our HHEU Unconference have been free to attend and have offered travel reimbursements.
      
     <small>HHEU Unconference was kindly supported by sponsors and used resources from [HackNotts](https://www.hacknotts.com/) and [DurHack](https://durhack.com). 
     HHEU tries to keep all events open to everyone by making our events free and offer reasonable travel reimbursement where possible.</small>

- question: Where can I find out more information?
