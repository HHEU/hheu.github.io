# Hackathon Hackers Europe
We're hosting a casual meet-up for UK and European hackathon organisers!

This **unconference** is a chance to meet and chat with other hackathon organisers from across the UK. 

We'll also be hosting a watch party for Hackcon Digital in the afternoon!

## Why are we running this event?
We think the UK organiser community is a little separated right now. This year, there's no Hackcon EU taking place,
so we three community builders decided to form our own meet-ups. 

## Who's running this event?
We're growing Hackathon Hackers Europe (HHEU) to unite organisers all across the UK and continental Europe.
